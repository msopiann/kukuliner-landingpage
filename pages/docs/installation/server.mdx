# Server Setup

This guide will help you set up and run the project locally. Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A database set up for culinary data.
- A Google Maps API key.
- Model from Keras Tensorflow

## Prerequisites

### 1. Database Setup

Ensure you have a database configured for storing culinary data. The database details should be available and accessible. You can use any relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

### 2. Google Maps API Key

Obtain a Google Maps API key. Follow the instructions on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) to generate your API key.

## Steps to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash copy
git clone -b cloud-computing https://github.com/Xeismonium/Kukuliner.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies:

```bash copy
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash copy
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash copy
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variables:

```env copy
DB_HOST=xxx
DB_USER=xxx
DB_PASSWORD=xxx
DB_DATABASE=xxx
MODEL_URL=xxx
GMAPS_API=xxx

FLASK_DEBUG=1
PORT=8080
```

Replace all of these with with your actual data.

### 5. Run the Flask Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash copy
flask run
```

By default, the Flask application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

> [!NOTE]
> PORT 8080 in ENV is for use in the production stage.

## Accessing the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running commands.
- Double-check your environment variables in the `.env` file.
- Verify that your database is running and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages and stack traces.

For further assistance, refer to the project documentation or raise an issue on the project's repository.
